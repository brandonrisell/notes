Xamarin for .net developers
Brandon Minnick - Xamarin

Started talking general xamarin and MS stack

Switched to Talking about Mobile Center (Woohoo)

Demo
----

Using Vysor for Android and Quicktime for iOS, displaying devices on the screen

The app he's demoing is using MS' cognitive services

The app he's demoing is called Face Off. I'll have to see if Xamarin has it on github

Now he's talking about MS cognitive services. The app he demoed did expression recognition.
  * He said that the cognitive services call was a single line of code that was sent to cognitive services. I wonder how api keys and such work there?

Cognitive services has OCR, James and Nick might get a kick out of that.

Cognitive services has a free trial, 5000 calls a month or something like that, wonder if there's a limit to that?

Apparentl Uber uses Cognitive services for their driver sign in to verify that the driver is actually the person.

Face Off is on Cognitive services as a demo app

github user `brminnick`, and his repo for face off is `github.com/brminnick/faceoff`

Showing a demo in Xamarin Studio, but did a quick shoutout for Visual Studio

Gorram keyboard on this thing is loud.

Look up his app in the app store later. He mentioned that his app uses Xamarin.Forms

[[Random]] Does DependencyService butt heads with the linker, esp when link all is set?
