Zach Donnell gave me a rundown of some photography basics, saving it here:

- Low aperature = more light, less image in focus (blurry background)
- High aperature = less light, more image in focus

- Low ISO = highest quality, but darkest image
- High ISO = lower quality (more noise) but brightens image.

- Fast shutter = less light in, but sharpest if anything is moving.
- Slow shutter = more light in, but risk getting blurry for moving subjects or if your hand is shaky
